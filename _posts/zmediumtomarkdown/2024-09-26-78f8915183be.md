### „ÄêOmniverse„ÄëDevelopment 101: Getting Started with Kit\-Based Development

‰∏≠ÊñáÁâàÊú¨Ôºö [„ÄêOmniverse„ÄëÂ≠∏ÁøíÁ≠ÜË®ò ‚Äî 00ÔºöKit\-based Development](https://medium.com/maochinn/omniverse-%E5%AD%B8%E7%BF%92%E7%AD%86%E8%A8%98-00-kit-based-development-a54ae65f22bf?source=your_stories_page-------------------------------------){:target="_blank"}

Despite the buzz around Omniverse, there are surprisingly few articles on how to develop with it\. If you visit the official website, you‚Äôll be advised against using the old Omniverse Launcher and instead directed to Kit\-based development\.

### Getting Started with Omniverse Kit


> **Omniverse Kit is the SDK for building Omniverse applications** like Create and View\. It can also be used to develop your own Omniverse applications\. 





[**Overview ‚Äî Omniverse Kit 106\.1\.0 documentation**](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/kit/docs/kit-manual/latest/guide/kit_overview.html){:target="_blank"} 
[_As mentioned above, Pixar‚Äôs Hydra is used to interface between USD and RTX\._ docs\.omniverse\.nvidia\.com](https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/kit/docs/kit-manual/latest/guide/kit_overview.html){:target="_blank"}

However, using the SDK directly can be quite challenging\. Fortunately, NVIDIA provides three main ways to develop your own applications on the download omniverse page:
1. **Omniverse Launcher** : This is essentially a pre\-built application using Kit\. Users can open it without writing any code\. Think of it as an official release version where you can install extensions\.
2. **Kit Base Editor** : This is a minimal application built using [**Omniverse Kit SDK**](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/teams/omniverse/resources/kit-sdk/files){:target="_blank"} \. It serves as a basic template, composed of various extensions\. You can think of it as a starting point for your own applications\.
3. [**Kit\-App\-Template**](https://github.com/NVIDIA-Omniverse/kit-app-template){:target="_blank"} : This requires you to build the application yourself\. NVIDIA provides several templates to help you get started\. This method offers the most flexibility, allowing you to decide which extensions to include in your application\.

### Diving into Kit\-Based Development

Given that our goal is development, let‚Äôs start with the **kit\-app\-template** \. Opening it, you‚Äôll find five templates that you can build upon:
- **Kit Service** : A minimal service leveraging Omniverse Kit functionality\.
- **Kit Base Editor** : A minimal application for loading, manipulating, and rendering OpenUSD content\.
- **USD Composer** : For authoring complex OpenUSD scenes\.
- **USD Explorer** : For exploring and collaborating on large OpenUSD scenes\.
- **USD Viewer** : A viewport\-only application suitable for streaming content to web pages\.


Most of the time, you‚Äôll be using the **Kit Base Editor** \. Despite being minimal, it has all the essential features, and you can even use it like Blender\.

### Learning Paths and Courses

To get started, I will starts with three basic courses, two of which are based on the official learning path and one is an additional course that I found elsewhere\.


![Figure 3: Learning path developed based on Omniverse Kit](/assets/78f8915183be/1*96JSVd1mtkEXLgmIJ4ecSg.png)

Figure 3: Learning path developed based on Omniverse Kit
1. [**Essentials of Developing NVIDIA Omniverse Kit Applications**](https://learn.nvidia.com/courses/course-detail?course_id=course-v1:DLI+S-OV-11+V1){:target="_blank"} : This course teaches you how to build the Kit Base Editor and add a simple extension\. The unique aspect of this course is that it focuses on adding extensions to the `.Kit` file rather than directly to the application, and then building the application based on this `.Kit` file\.
2. [**Creating and Customizing an Omniverse Extension**](https://learn.nvidia.com/courses/course-detail?course_id=course-v1:DLI+S-OV-16+V1){:target="_blank"} : This course covers adding UI elements and commands to your extensions, including how to place extensions in the menu and add other command functionalities\.
3. [**Develop, Customize, and Publish in Omniverse With Extensions**](https://learn.nvidia.com/courses/course?course_id=course-v1:DLI+S-OV-02+V1){:target="_blank"} : This comprehensive course includes debugging methods and working with USD files\. It is divided into two parts: understanding `.usd` files \(Universal Scene Description\) and creating a scatter object extension\. Although the official scatter extension has been removed, you can create a similar one to use in subsequent courses\.

### Tips and Tricks

While following these courses, you might encounter some gaps or outdated instructions\. Here are a few tips:
- Where this course refers to the Omniverse Code application, you can instead use the Kit Base Editor application you created as part of this setup process\.
- When using the Kit\-App\-Template, if you don‚Äôt see Extensions in the menu, remember to add `-d` when launching\.

```typescript
.\repo.bat launch -d
```
- For creating commands, ensure you update the `__init__.py` file correctly\.

```python
__all__ = ["ScatterCreatePointInstancerCommand", "ScatterWindowExtension", "ScatterWindow"]

from .commands import ScatterCreatePointInstancerCommand
from .extension import ScatterWindowExtension
from .window import ScatterWindow
```
- Uncomment necessary lines in `window.py` to display UI elements like ComboBox\.

```python
ui.ComboBox(self._scatter_type_model)
```
### Final Thoughts

Despite the extensive promotion of Omniverse, there are few development\-focused articles\. The official tutorials and documentation are scattered and sometimes outdated\.
